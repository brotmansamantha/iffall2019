		<p><span>[Intro]</span><br>
			Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh<br>
			Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh</p>
		<section>
			<p><span>[Verse]</span><br>
			Once upon a time, it was paradise<br>
			Once upon a time, I was paralyzed<br>
			Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights<br>
			But it's time to let it go<br>
			Once upon a time, it was made for us<br>
			Woke up one day, it had turned to dust<br>
			Baby, we were found, but now we're lost<br>
			So it's time to let it go</p>
		<section>
			<p><span>[Pre-Chorus]</span><br>
			I want my house in the hills<br>
			Don't want the whiskey and pills<br>
			I don't give up easily<br>
			But I don't think I'm down</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p><span>[Chorus]</span><br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights<br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away<br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights<br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away</p>

		<section>
			<p><span>[Verse Reprise]</span><br>
			Once upon a time, it was paradise<br>
			Once upon a time, I was paralyzed<br>
			Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights<br>
			But it's time to let it go<br>
			Once upon a time, it was made for us (For us)<br>
			Woke up one day, it had turned to dust<br>
			Baby, we were found, but now we're lost<br>
			So it's time to let it go</p>

			<p><span>[Pre-Chorus]</span><br>
			Move on, we're not seventeen<br>
			I'm not who I used to be<br>
			You say that everything changed<br>
			You're right, we're grown now</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p><span>[Chorus]</span><br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights<br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away<br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights<br>
			So won't you slide away?<br>
			Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away</p>

			<p><span>[Outro]</span><br>
			Move on, we're not seventeen<br>
			I'm not who I used to be<br>
			You say that everything changed<br>
			You're right, we're grown now</p>
