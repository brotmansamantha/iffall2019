			 <em>Feedback from Steven Lee:</em> <br>
			 <p>Steven suggested that I make my font size larger because it is currently a bit small for a phone screen. </p>
			 <p>At first, Steven recommended that I add more images throughout. I explained that personally, when I am cooking from a phone recipe, I don't like having to scroll past many images, but rather need the next step. Afterwards, Steven understood and agreed. </p>
			 <p>Steven expressed some concern about how I will execute the dropdown menus for "ingredients" and "directions." I agreed and will experiment before I commit to that design. </p>
