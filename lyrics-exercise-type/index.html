			<div class="lyrics">
				I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <br>
				This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <br>
				I need somebody to heal, somebody to know <br>
				Somebody to have, somebody to hold <br>
				It's easy to say, but it's never the same <br>
				I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain</div></p>
		<p><div class="header">[Chorus]</div>
			<div class="lyrics"> 
				Now the day bleeds into nightfall <br>
				And you're not here to get me through it all <br>
				I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <br>
				I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <br></div></p>
		<p><div class="header">[Verse 2]</div>
			<div class="lyrics">
				I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to<br>
				This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you<br>
				Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear<br>
				Somebody to have, just to know how it feels<br>
				It's easy to say, but it's never the same<br>
				I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape<br></div></p>
		<p><div class="header">[Chorus]</div>
			<div class="lyrics">
				Now the day bleeds into nightfall <br>
				And you're not here to get me through it all <br>
				I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <br>
				I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <br></div></p>
		<p><div class="header">[Bridge]</div>
			<div class="lyrics">
				And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <br>
				I fall into your arms <br>
				I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <br></div></p>
		<p><div class="header">[Chorus]</div>
			<div class="lyrics">
				For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <br>
				And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
				I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
				I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br>
				But now the day bleeds into nightfall<br>
				And you're not here to get me through it all<br>
				I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
				I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br>
				I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug<br>
				I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved<br></div></p>
