<p class="one">Relationships and Sobriety:</p>

<p>Woods dated fashion designer Brittany Byrd from 2014 to 2017. Byrd, a popular figure among Woods' fans, was attending Parsons School of Design after moving from California to attend the school when she met Woods. Woods first referenced Byrd in the song "Nuyork Nights at 21" from Luv Is Rage and has since made multiple songs about the designer, even appearing in the music video for Woods breakout single, "Money Longer". On June 26, 2017, the couple broke up with Woods announcing the news with a new song titled "Stole Your Luv".</p>

<p>Following the death of rapper Lil Peep, Woods announced he was quitting drugs and was attempting sobriety.</p>

<p>After the death of rapper and friend XXXTentacion, Woods asked for help on social media from other rappers for helping to build a foundation against gun violence which would help to keep XXXTentacion's family and future child provided for.</p><br>

<p class="two">Controversies:</p>

<p>Woods has been accused of being a Satanist, originally by battle rapper Daylyt who claimed that Woods worshipped Satan. Woods has been said to be inspired by Marilyn Manson's worship and support of Satan, who he called his biggest inspiration. In July 2018, Woods told a crowd of fans that they were "going to hell" with him.</p>

<p>In August 2017, Woods created controversy by adding satanic imagery to his social media accounts and saying phrases often associated with Satanism such as "666". Woods frequently promotes Satanism on his social media, which went far enough to warrant his Instagram access being taken from him by his record label.</p><br>

<p class="three">Feuds:</p>

<p>Woods has had a long-standing stand-still with Generation Now imprint owners Don Cannon and DJ Drama over his music. Woods has insulted Don Cannon and DJ Drama over the delays to his Luv Is Rage 2 album, advised people against signing with Generation Now and referred to DJ Drama as an "old person".</p>

<p>On April 29, 2016, Atlanta rapper OG Maco went on a rant on social media where he claims that he "paved the way" for Woods and that Woods was "stealing his sauce", referring to his style. Maco implied there was no issue between Woods and him though Woods took offense to Maco's comment who mentioned Atlanta rapper Reese LaFlare who Woods was feuding with. In August 2016, Woods attempted to assault Reese LaFlare at Day N Night Fest after seeing him through a security barrier, though he was stopped by security. In September 2016, OG Maco and Woods resolved their feud. In January 2018, Woods punched Reese LaFlare in the face and bragged about it on social media, later deleting the tweet.</p>

<p>In early 2018, Woods had tweeted about how he was unhappy at DJ Drama's label, Generation Now. In response, fellow rapper Rich The Kid had replied saying that had Woods signed to his label, Rich Forever Music, he would have never had that problem. Woods responded by saying "Boy I'm not signing for 20racks" ($20,000). Rich then replied that it would have been worth accepting the offer either way. Soon enough, things escalated with disses on Instagram and Twitter between the two. In March 2018, Rich the Kid released a diss track on Woods, titled "Dead Friends", a play on words of Woods's catchphrase in his hit single, "XO Tour Llif3". An incident occurred in June 2018 at a Starbucks between Rich the Kid and Lil Uzi Vert, who attempted to attack Rich the Kid but was stopped by security.</p>
