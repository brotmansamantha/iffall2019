	<h1>Feedback</h1>
	<p>
		<p><i>Ali Gold:</i> </p>
		<span>1.</span> The header font is not very consistent with other font (she thinks it looks like old-fashioned digital type)<br>
		<span>2.</span> Ali suggested that I add more pictures throughout after each step. I explained to her that when I personally cook from a website I don't like having to scroll past many pictures and find it a nuissance<br>
		<span>3.</span> She said that instead of adding more recipe pictures I could add a picture with my family in the description section <br>
		<span>4.</span> Ali said that little circles highlighting the direction numbers look somewhat strange because of the shape and alignment with the numbers<br>
		<span>5.</span> She said the font size could be slightly larger<br>
	</p>

		<p><i>Rachel Zemser:</i> </p>
		<span>1.</span> Rachel said that the background pattern is distracting<br>
		<span>2.</span> She also said that the font size should be a little bit larger<br>
		<span>3.</span> Rachel liked the highlights on the direction numbers so I will try to find a way to make them look more normal to incorporate Ali's feedback with Rachel's<br>
		<span>4.</span> She said to add another vertical line after the word Google in the footer<br>
		<span>5.</span> Spacing looks good
