			<font face=arial body copy><li>My name is Samantha Brotman. I am a junior studying Marketing with a second major in Communication Design (technically, I am still in the process of switching to Olin for my primary major, though!).</li><br>
			<li>I am from Philadelphia. I was prompted to take this class because technology is the future of the world and I want to be prepared!</li><br>
			<li>I have absolutely no experience with HTML/CSS/JS or any type of coding.</li><br>
			<li>In this class, I really want to learn basic HTML coding and how to design for the web.</li><br>
			<li>I expect that desiging for a screen is different than desiging on paper becuase there are more options on the web, such as changing colors or animated objects.</li><br>
			<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a> I chose the New York Times as a website that exemplifies effective design because of its use of the grid, hierarchic scale shifts, and integration of images.</li><br>
			<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> I chose Amazon as a website that I think communicates effectively. The site is set up clearly, has a clear navigation system, and is categorized well.</li><br>
			<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a> I chose Netflix as a website that works well overall because it maintains seperate users within one account, has the ability to offer suggestions to viewers, and is easy to navigate.</li></font><br>
