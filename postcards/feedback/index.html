		<h1>Feedback for Trevor</h1><h2>From Samantha Brotman</h2>
		<div>
		<p>-Images are relatively plain and there is a lot of potential for text placement and they work well as both landscapes and portraits. </p>
		<p>-You could definitely find a way to eliminate the black box. Perhaps, choosing a bolder typeface and adding a drop shadow. Though, the fire and water images might be more difficult to eliminate the box from, if you edit the image by darkening or blurring a portion the background for example, it might work. </p>
		<p>-Contrast of white text works really nicely on the green water image.</p>
		<p>-Consider  typeface choices. There is nothing wrong with it, but maybe there is one that relates more to your content.</p>
		<p>-Type treatment is nice for the book/author. </p>
